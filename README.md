AI-BASED-EMAIL-CLASSIFIER:
--------------------
This project includes text classification which is a multi-class classification where different classifiers are trained and tested using Python. The email classification is based on the content into three categories: Normal, Spam, and Fraud.

The classifiers used include Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM with Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier (SGD-SVM) and Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent classifier (SGD-LR). All these classifiers are trained with features extracted using the TF-IDF vectorizer.
Further, ensemble classifiers including Random Forest (R
